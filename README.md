Women Safety Analysis for Smart Cities

# Background
The rising concern over womenâ€™s safety in urban areas necessitates advanced surveillance and analytical solutions. Traditional security measures often lack real-time intervention capabilities.

# Problem Statement

# Expected Solution
AI-based person detection and gender classification
Detection of lone women in isolated areas at night
Gesture recognition for SOS signals
Identification of hotspots where safety risks are higher
Integration with law enforcement alert systems for proactive intervention
